## <a id="features"></a> Features

There are no changes in Ops Manager v2.10 that directly affect tile development for partners.

## <a id="known-issues"></a> Known Issues

Known issues in this release that may affect tile development for partners:

### <a id="non-configurable-certs"></a> Non-Configurable Certificates Are Invalid Within a Selector

An `rsa_cert_credentials` property with `configurable: false` is invalid within a `selector` property.

The tile does not raise any validation errors, but the following error appears during the pre-deploy check:

<pre>
{
  "pre_deploy_check": {
    ...
    "properties": [
      {
        "name": ".properties.EXAMPLE-CERT-PROPERTY",
        "type": "rsa_cert_credentials",
        "errors": [
          "can't be blank",
          "can't be blank"
        ]
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
Where `EXAMPLE-CERT-PROPERTY` is the property you specify.
