## <a id="features"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

### <a id='consul-server'></a> Consul Server Instance Removed from PAS

The consul server instance is removed from PAS. This saves VM resources and
reduces maintenance for managing a clustered component.

In PAS v2.4, the instance count for consul server VMs was scaled down to zero.
This allowed the consul server to continue to provide the consul link for tiles that consume it. In PAS v2.7, the consul server instance is removed from PAS.

For information about breaking changes caused by the removal of the consul server instance,
see [Consul Clients Not Supported in PAS](#consul-clients-not-supported).

### <a id='upgrade-service-instances'></a> Support for Upgrading Service Instances

PAS v2.7 includes CAPI v1.83.0, which supports upgrading service instances to the latest version of a service plan.
This is an optional feature that service authors can implement.

App developers can check the `upgrade available` column in the output of the `cf services` command
to see if a service broker supports upgrades. For more information,
see [Upgrade a Service Instance](https://docs.pivotal.io/devguide/services/managing-services#upgrade).

If you are a service author and want to enable this feature,
see [Updating a Service Instance](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/spec.md#updating-a-service-instance)
in the _Open Service Broker API Specification_.

### <a id="use-stemcell"></a> BOSH Jobs Can Run on Different Stemcells

Tile authors can specify the stemcell a BOSH job uses with the `use_stemcell` property.
When `use_stemcell` is specified for a job, Ops Manager uploads this stemcell
to BOSH and BOSH deploys the given instance group on the specified stemcell.

Tile authors can use this property to enable jobs to run on different operating systems.
For example, a tile authors can configure one job to run on Linux and configure a different job to run on Windows.

For more information, see [use_stemcell](./property-template-references.html#job-use-stemcell).

## <a id="product-temp"></a> Product Template Property Improvements

The product template has the following improvements:

+ **`vcenter_credentials`:** Tile authors can use the `vcenter_credentials` type of `install_time_verifiers` property to verify vSphere `simple_credentials`.
For information about the vSphere form verifier,
see [install\_time\_verifiers](./property-template-references.html#top-verifier).

+ **`must_be_cron_schedule`:** Tile authors can use the `constraints.must_be_cron_schedule` attribute
of the `string` property blueprint type to verify
that form input is a valid `cron` expression.
For information about the `string` blueprint type,
see [string](./property-template-references.html#string).

## <a id="resolved"></a> Resolved Issues

This release fixes the following issues:

+ The Ops Manager syslog template now supports service broker tiles.
+ In Ops Manager v2.7.19 and later, tiles that are declared under `requires_product_versions`
  can successfully deploy even when `product_version` contains a build number.

## <a id="breaking-changes"></a> Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking changes:

### <a id='vcenter-user-pass'></a> Username and Password Properties Removed from vSphere Form Verifiers

The `vcenter_username` and `vcenter_password` properties have been removed from
the vSphere form verifier.

If tile authors added `Verifiers::VsphereConfigurationVerifier`
to their tile, they must replace the `vcenter_username` and `vcenter_password` properties
with the `vcenter_credentials` property. If tile authors do not replace
the username and password properties,
the vSphere form verifier fails and prevents deployment.

For information about vSphere form verifiers,
see [install\_time\_verifiers](./property-template-references.html#top-verifier).

### <a id='consul-clients-not-supported'></a> Consul Clients Not Supported in PAS

The consul server instance is removed from PAS. Tiledev authors must remove any
consul clients from their products to avoid failed deployments.

To remove consul clients from your products, make the following changes to any
`job_type` that is colocated with `consul_agent`:

```
- name: consul_agent
    release: consul
    ...
    manifest: |
      ...
      consul:
        client:
          enabled: "(( $ops_manager.dns_enabled ? false : true ))"
```

For more information about removing consul clients from your products,
see [Tile Authors Must Remove consul_agent](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-4/release-notes.html#breaking-consul)
in the PCF v2.4 Partner Release Notes.

## <a id="known-issues"></a> Known Issues

Known issues in this release that may affect tile development for partners:

### <a id="non-configurable-certs"></a> Non-Configurable Certificates Are Invalid Within a Selector

An `rsa_cert_credentials` property with `configurable: false` is invalid within a `selector` property.

The tile does not raise any validation errors, but the following error appears during the pre-deploy check:

<pre>
{
  "pre_deploy_check": {
    ...
    "properties": [
      {
        "name": ".properties.EXAMPLE-CERT-PROPERTY",
        "type": "rsa_cert_credentials",
        "errors": [
          "can't be blank",
          "can't be blank"
        ]
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
Where `EXAMPLE-CERT-PROPERTY` is the property you specify.
