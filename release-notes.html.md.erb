## <a id="features"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

### <a id='om-time-verifier'></a> HTTP Install-Time Verifier
Tile authors can define an `HttpSuccessVerifier` install-time verifier that calls an
HTTP endpoint on the broker.

Ops Manager executes this verifier after you click **Apply Changes**.
If the HTTP response is not successful, the deployment fails and
the verifier displays a warning message.

Tile authors can use this verifier
to check if all service instances on an existing broker are on the current version.
This prevents service instances from becoming orphaned after an upgrade.
Tile authors can also specify that the verifier should only run on major or minor upgrades.

## <a id="resolved"></a> Resolved Issues

This release fixes the following issue:

+ In Ops Manager v2.8.2 and later, tiles that are declared under `requires_product_versions`
  can successfully deploy even when `product_version` contains a build number.

## <a id="known-issues"></a> Known Issues

Known issues in this release that may affect tile development for partners:

### <a id="non-configurable-certs"></a> Non-Configurable Certificates Are Invalid Within a Selector

An `rsa_cert_credentials` property with `configurable: false` is invalid within a `selector` property.

The tile does not raise any validation errors, but the following error appears during the pre-deploy check:

<pre>
{
  "pre_deploy_check": {
    ...
    "properties": [
      {
        "name": ".properties.EXAMPLE-CERT-PROPERTY",
        "type": "rsa_cert_credentials",
        "errors": [
          "can't be blank",
          "can't be blank"
        ]
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
Where `EXAMPLE-CERT-PROPERTY` is the property you specify.
