## <a id="features"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

### <a id="domain-style-url"></a> Tile Developers Can Use Domain-Style URLs for S3-Compatible Blobstores

A `use_path_style` property allows tile developers to optionally enable virtual-hosted-style, or domain-style, URLs for S3-compatible blobstores in the BlobstoreVerifier.

By default, the `use_path_style` property is `true`, which means that the blobstore uses path-style URLs. To use domain-style URLs, set `use_path_style` to `false`.

This property allows you to use domain-style URLs for S3-compatible blobstores before AWS ends support for path-style URLs in October 2020.

For more information about the end of support for path-style S3 bucket URLs, see [Amazon S3 Path Deprecation Plan â€“ The Rest of the Story](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/) in the AWS News Blog.

For more information about the difference between path-style and virtual-hosted-style URLs, see [Virtual Hosting of Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html) in the AWS documentation.

### <a id="credhub-maestro-support"></a> Support for CredHub Maestro and Ops Manager Bulk Rotation of Certificates

Ops Manager v2.9 invokes CredHub Maestro to perform the bulk rotation of various CAs
and certificates within a foundation.

To ensure compatibility with Ops Manager API certificate rotation
and CredHub Maestro, you must use the concatenated
`LEAF-CERTIFICATE-NAME.ca` format when referencing CAs
that sign leaf certificates in your tile's property configuration.
Do not reference the CA directly with the format `CA-CERTIFICATE-NAME.certificate`.

The `.ca` accessor format returns a concatenated version of the CA,
which includes the older and newer CA. The concatenated version ensures
that jobs using leaf certificates do not lose trusted state during CA rotation
and results in the least amount of downtime for your tile's services during certificate rotation.

For more information and configuration examples, see [Reference Existing CAs and Certificates in CredHub Variables](create-credhub-vars.html#credhub-ca-refs).

## <a id="known-issues"></a> Known Issues

Known issues in this release that may affect tile development for partners:

### <a id="non-configurable-certs"></a> Non-Configurable Certificates Are Invalid Within a Selector

An `rsa_cert_credentials` property with `configurable: false` is invalid within a `selector` property.

The tile does not raise any validation errors, but the following error appears during the pre-deploy check:

<pre>
{
  "pre_deploy_check": {
    ...
    "properties": [
      {
        "name": ".properties.EXAMPLE-CERT-PROPERTY",
        "type": "rsa_cert_credentials",
        "errors": [
          "can't be blank",
          "can't be blank"
        ]
      }
    ],
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
Where `EXAMPLE-CERT-PROPERTY` is the property you specify.
